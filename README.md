This is going to be the respository for all of our code that we need to share.

To begin, open the git bash in the folder you wish the repository to go into.
Also go to the main page of the repository website (on Git) it should be the page you are looking at now.
Once there, click the clone or download green button and copy the url there.

In the git bash command line type "git clone <URL YOU JUST COPIED>"

Bada-bing-bada-boom its there magically!

Other good things to know are "git pull" which updates your repo to whatever is on the git server.

To add or commit a file here are the steps:

"git add ." This adds all the files with changes and preps them to be committed.
"git commit -m "some message of your choosing" " The message goes along with the push and helps identify what you did with each commit.
"git push" this pushes all changes to the git server. Let your partner know when you have pushed so they can pull down your changes.
